    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work', metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth', metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences and interactions with various segments of society, including politicians, scientists, academics, artists, and youth. He highlights 10 important messages that he wants to convey, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development and fulfilling the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence\n",
      "3. Promoting agricultural growth and food security\n",
      "4. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage\n",

      "6. Defending the nation and promoting national pride\n",
      "7. Encouraging a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He specifically recounts a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020, and how it inspired him to think about the country's potential for growth and development. The speech is a reflection on his tenure and a call to action for the people of India to work together towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the nation's highest institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker reflects on their interactions with over 15 lakh youth, representing the dreams of 540 million young people in the nation. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, citing a personal experience in Nagaland where they witnessed a village council functioning effectively with financial powers. The speaker also highlights the success of the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative, \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA), which has improved the lives of 3 lakh people in 65 villages by providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic growth and employment generation. The overall theme of the speech is the need to empower villages and provide connectivity to unlock India's potential and achieve development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the help of self-help groups. The project has developed wasteland into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, power generation, and food processing. The project has also collaborated with experts from Japan to develop internationally competitive prototypes for lifestyle products. The speaker believes that this model can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide, and estimates that 7000 such projects are needed across the country to achieve sustainable economic development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the speaker's enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker also mentions a national symposium on agriculture, where they discussed ways to double agricultural production despite reduced land, water, and manpower. The speaker expresses confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech then shifts to a personal anecdote about meeting a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, Krishna Murthy is a happy and confident person who attributes his success to the support of his family, teachers, and others. He asks to sing in front of the speaker, demonstrating his positive attitude and determination to overcome his challenges. The speech concludes with a message of overcoming problems and succeeding despite adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech consists of two inspiring stories. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disability, has developed a remarkable talent for music. With the support of his parents, teachers, and others, he has been able to blossom and now wants to share his art with others to inspire them. He has even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and was impressed by the courage and resilience of the people, who were able to overcome their problems with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government. The villagers have shown an indomitable spirit and have become the masters of their problems, rather than letting their problems master them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is one of hope, resilience, and the power of positive attitude and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters. The speaker describes visiting a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief efforts with the Armed Forces, and a temporary school set up in tents. They also mention visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met with tribal leaders and were impressed by the community's courage and willingness to care for affected victims. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate the islanders' bravery, which was sung by the villagers. The speech also touches on the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary is cut off before further details are provided. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of courage and community in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the \"Pan African e-Network\" concept at an African Union meeting, aiming to connect 53 African countries with a seamless network (satellite, fiber optics, and wireless) at a cost of $100 million. The project will link 12 universities and 17 hospitals (from India and Africa) with tele-medicine and tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project has been launched in Ethiopia, with Indian institutions providing educational and medical services, including an MBA course and tele-medicine services from CARE Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses three main topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India's collaboration with Africa**: The speaker mentions a tele-consultation project between Hyderabad and a hospital in Addis Ababa, and how India's experience in using technology for societal benefit is being shared with Africa to bring about transformation on the continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, sharing personal experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, being on a submarine, and flying in a fighter jet. They commend the bravery and dedication of India's soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who work tirelessly to protect the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for a developed India**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\". The goal is to contribute to India's development by empowering its youth.\n",

      "APJ Abdul Kalam's departing speech as President of India reflects on his 5-year tenure, expresses gratitude, and shares key messages. He emphasizes accelerating development, empowering villages, and a youth movement for a developed India by 2020. This vision is inspired by a question from a young girl who asked why India can't become a developed nation before 2020. He appreciated the question and assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on. The desire for a developed India has entered the minds of the youth, with over 15 lakh youth met by Kalam echoing this dream. He recalls his visit to Nagaland, where he saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers, and highlights the need for physical connectivity and the transformation that can occur if villages are empowered. Kalam also discusses the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which provides urban amenities in rural areas, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with notable achievements including the development of 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land and the creation of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). Additionally, he notes the positive impact of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, promoting self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. Kalam emphasizes the importance of empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, considering them the most powerful resource for the country's development. He also stresses the need to preserve India's rich and diverse cultural heritage while pursuing economic growth. Furthermore, he envisions a developed India with a reduced rural-urban divide, equitable distribution of energy and water, and a harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and service sectors. He resolves to work towards a nation where education is accessible to all meritorious candidates, and where India becomes a destination for top talent from around the world. These experiences reinforce his vision for a nation with 10 key attributes, including: a nation where the rural-urban divide is bridged, a nation with a strong and competitive economy, and others such as a nation with the best of healthcare available to all, a nation with responsive and corruption-free governance, a nation where poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated, and a nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy with a sustainable growth path. He emphasizes the need for 7000 PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide, which is crucial to achieving his vision for a developed India by 2020.\n",
